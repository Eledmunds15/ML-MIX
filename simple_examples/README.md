# Simple Examples
These folders contain simple examples which aim to showcase and explain as many features of ML-MIX as possible. All expensive and ML/ML examples are provided in each case.

For the ML/ML examples, a well-commented input script is provided alongside a normal one. For a user who wants to quickly get a good feel of how ML-MIX works, it is recommended they read through these commented input scripts.

All examples use pure LAMMPS, not LAMMPS/python as the more complex examples given in `case_studies/` do.
